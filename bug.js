In Next.js 15, a particularly uncommon bug can arise when using the `app` directory's `async` capabilities in conjunction with middleware.  If you have middleware that modifies the request (e.g., redirects) and an async action within a page component attempts to access request-specific data (e.g., cookies set by the middleware) before the middleware's modifications are fully applied, the data will be incorrect.  This often leads to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect session data or missing query parameters.
